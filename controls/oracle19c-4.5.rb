    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME

    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_TABLES A
    WHERE TABLE_NAME='USER$MIG' AND OWNER='SYS';
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.

  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    DROP TABLE SYS.USER$MIG;
