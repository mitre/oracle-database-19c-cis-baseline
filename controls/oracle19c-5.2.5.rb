designated user to access `SYS` schema objects. Unauthorized grantees should
not have that privilege."

which would allow an unauthorized user to gather information about the database
through data dictionary objects. Information collected could potentially be
used to exploit the database."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE
    FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='SELECT ANY DICTIONARY'
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM DBA_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```
    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_SYS_PRIVS A
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='SELECT ANY DICTIONARY'
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM CDB_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM CDB_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    REVOKE SELECT ANY DICTIONARY FROM <grantee>;
    ```
