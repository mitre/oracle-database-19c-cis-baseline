  title "Ensure the 'SYNONYM' Audit Option Is Enabled"
  desc  "The `SYNONYM` operation allows for the creation of an alternative name
for a database object such as a Java class schema object, materialized view,
operator, package, procedure, sequence, stored function, table, view,
user-defined object type, or even another synonym. This synonym puts a
dependency on its target and is rendered invalid if the target object is
changed/dropped. Enabling the audit option causes all user activities involving
the creation or dropping of synonyms to be audited."
  desc  'rationale', "As the logging of user activities involving the creation
or dropping of a `SYNONYM` can provide forensic evidence about a pattern of
suspect/unauthorized activities, the audit capability should be enabled."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE
    FROM DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS
    WHERE USER_NAME IS NULL
    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL
    AND SUCCESS = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND FAILURE = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND AUDIT_OPTION='SYNONYM';
    ```
    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has auditing
turned on. To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE,
     DECODE (A.CON_ID,
     0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS A
    WHERE USER_NAME IS NULL
    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL
    AND SUCCESS = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND FAILURE = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND AUDIT_OPTION='SYNONYM';
    ```
    Lack of results implies a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement in either
the non multi-tenant or container database, it does NOT need run in the
pluggable.
    ```
    AUDIT SYNONYM;
