  title "Ensure the 'ALTER ROLE' Action Audit Is Enabled"
  desc  "An Oracle database role is a collection or set of privileges that can
be granted to users or other roles. Roles may include system privileges, object
privileges or other roles. The `ALTER ROLE` statement is used to change the
authorization needed to enable a role. Enabling this unified action audit
causes logging of all `ALTER ROLE` statements, whether successful or
unsuccessful, issued by the users regardless of the privileges held by the
users to issue such statements."
  desc  'rationale', "Logging and monitoring of all attempts to alter roles,
whether successful or unsuccessful, may provide clues and forensic evidence
about potential suspicious/unauthorized activities. Any such activities may be
a cause for further investigation. In addition, organization security policies
and industry/government regulations may require logging of all user activities
involving alteration of roles."
