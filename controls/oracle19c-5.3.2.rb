privileges for a number of packages and procedures in the data dictionary in
the `SYS` schema. Unauthorized grantees should not have that role."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only**: To assess this
recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, GRANTED_ROLE
    FROM DBA_ROLE_PRIVS

    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE

    **Multi-tenant in the container database**: This query will also give you
the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue. To assess this recommendation,
execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, GRANTED_ROLE,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))

ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM CDB_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```

    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    REVOKE EXECUTE_CATALOG_ROLE FROM <grantee>;
    ```
