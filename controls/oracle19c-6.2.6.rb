  title "Ensure the 'DROP ROLE' Action Audit Is Enabled"
  desc  "An Oracle database role is a collection or set of privileges that can
be granted to users or other roles. Roles may include system privileges, object
privileges or other roles. Enabling this unified audit action enables logging
of all `DROP ROLE` statements, successful or unsuccessful, issued by the users
regardless of the privileges held by the users to issue such statements."
  desc  'rationale', "Logging and monitoring of all attempts to drop roles,
whether successful or unsuccessful, may provide clues and forensic evidence
about potential suspicious/unauthorized activities. Any such activities may be
a cause for further investigation. In addition, organization security policies
and industry/government regulations may require logging of all user activities
involving `DROP ROLE`."
