    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE

    WHERE USER_NAME IS NULL
    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL

    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has auditing
turned on. To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE,
     DECODE (A.CON_ID,
     0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),

    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL
    AND SUCCESS = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND FAILURE = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND AUDIT_OPTION='GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE';

    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement in either
the non multi-tenant or container database, it does NOT need run in the
pluggable.
    ```
    AUDIT GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE;
