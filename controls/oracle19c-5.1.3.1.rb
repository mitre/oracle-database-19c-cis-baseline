  desc  "The Oracle database `SYS.AUD$` table contains all the audit records
for the database of the non-Data Manipulation Language (DML) events, such as
`ALTER`, `DROP`, and `CREATE`, and so forth. (DML changes need trigger-based
audit events to record data alterations.) Unauthorized grantees should not have
full access to that table."
  desc  'rationale', "Permitting non-privileged users the authorization to
manipulate the `SYS.AUD$` table can allow distortion of the audit records,
hiding unauthorized activities."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE
    FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME='AUD$'
    AND OWNER = 'SYS';
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.

    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_TAB_PRIVS A
    WHERE TABLE_NAME='AUD$'
    AND OWNER = 'SYS';
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    REVOKE ALL ON AUD$ FROM <grantee>;
    ```
