    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE, TABLE_NAME
    FROM DBA_TAB_PRIVS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME in
('CDB_LOCAL_ADMINAUTH$','DEFAULT_PWD$','ENC$','HISTGRM$','HIST_HEAD$','LINK$','PDB_SYNC$','SCHEDULER$_CREDENTIAL','USER$','USER_HISTORY$','XS$VERIFIERS')
    AND OWNER = 'SYS'
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM DBA_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.

    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.

    ```
    SELECT TABLE_NAME, PRIVILEGE, GRANTEE,DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM
V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID)) DATABASE
    FROM CDB_TAB_PRIVS A
    WHERE TABLE_NAME in
('CDB_LOCAL_ADMINAUTH$','DEFAULT_PWD$','ENC$','HISTGRM$','HIST_HEAD$','LINK$','PDB_SYNC$','SCHEDULER$_CREDENTIAL','USER$','USER_HISTORY$','XS$VERIFIERS')

    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM DBA_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    ORDER BY CON_ID, TABLE_NAME;
