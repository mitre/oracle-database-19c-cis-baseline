Any User"

a user can be authenticated by a remote OS to allow access to the database with
full authorization. This setting should not be used."

database can potentially allow supposed \"privileged users\" to connect as
\"authenticated,\" even when the remote system is compromised."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE AUTHENTICATION_TYPE = 'EXTERNAL';
    ```
    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT A.USERNAME,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B
     WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_USERS A
    WHERE AUTHENTICATION_TYPE = 'EXTERNAL';
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    ALTER USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password>;
    ```
