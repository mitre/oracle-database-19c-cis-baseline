    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE
    FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE'
    AND GRANTEE='DBSNMP';

    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_SYS_PRIVS A
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE'
    AND GRANTEE='DBSNMP';
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.

    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    REVOKE EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE FROM DBSNMP;
    ```
