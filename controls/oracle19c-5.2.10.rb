  title "Ensure 'CREATE PROCEDURE' Is Revoked from Unauthorized 'GRANTEE'"
  desc  "The Oracle database `CREATE PROCEDURE` privilege allows the designated
user to create a stored procedure that will fire when given the correct command
sequence. Unauthorized grantees should not have that privilege."
  desc  'rationale', "The `CREATE PROCEDURE` privilege can lead to severe
problems in unauthorized hands, such as rogue procedures facilitating data
theft or denial-of-service by corrupting data tables."
  desc  'check', "
    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE
    FROM DBA_SYS_PRIVS
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='CREATE PROCEDURE'
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM DBA_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM DBA_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```
    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has the issue.
To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT GRANTEE, PRIVILEGE,
    DECODE (A.CON_ID,0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_SYS_PRIVS A
    WHERE PRIVILEGE='CREATE PROCEDURE'
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT USERNAME FROM CDB_USERS WHERE
ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y')
    AND GRANTEE NOT IN (SELECT ROLE FROM CDB_ROLES WHERE ORACLE_MAINTAINED='Y');
    ```
    Lack of results implies compliance.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement, keeping in
mind if this is granted in both container and pluggable database, you must
connect to both places to revoke.
    ```
    REVOKE CREATE PROCEDURE FROM <grantee>;
    ```
