  title "Ensure the 'ROLE' Audit Option Is Enabled"
  desc  "The `ROLE` object allows for the creation of a set of privileges that
can be granted to users or other roles. Enabling the audit option causes
auditing of all attempts, successful or not, to create, drop, alter or set
roles."
  desc  'rationale', "Roles are a key database security infrastructure
component. Any attempt to create, drop or alter a role should be audited. This
statement auditing option also audits attempts, successful or not, to set a
role in a session. Any unauthorized attempts to create, drop or alter a role
may be worthy of investigation. Attempts to set a role by users without the
role privilege may warrant investigation."

    **Non multi-tenant or pluggable database only:**

    To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE
    FROM DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS
    WHERE USER_NAME IS NULL
    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL
    AND SUCCESS = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND FAILURE = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND AUDIT_OPTION='ROLE';
    ```
    **Multi-tenant in the container database:**

    This query will also give you the name of the CDB/PDB that has auditing
turned on. To assess this recommendation, execute the following SQL statement.
    ```
    SELECT AUDIT_OPTION,SUCCESS,FAILURE,
     DECODE (A.CON_ID,
     0,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     1,(SELECT NAME FROM V$DATABASE),
     (SELECT NAME FROM V$PDBS B WHERE A.CON_ID = B.CON_ID))
    FROM CDB_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS A
    WHERE USER_NAME IS NULL
    AND PROXY_NAME IS NULL
    AND SUCCESS = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND FAILURE = 'BY ACCESS'
    AND AUDIT_OPTION='ROLE';
    ```
    Lack of results implies a finding.

  desc 'fix', "
    To remediate this setting, execute the following SQL statement in either
the non multi-tenant or container database, it does NOT need run in the
pluggable.
    ```
    AUDIT ROLE;
