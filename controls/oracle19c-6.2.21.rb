functions and access database as defined by PL/SQL code and SQL statements

logging of all `ALTER PROCEDURE`, `ALTER FUNCTION`, `ALTER PACKAGE` and `ALTER

successful or unsuccessful, to alter procedures, functions, packages or package
bodies may provide clues and forensic evidence about potential
suspicious/unauthorized activities. Any such activities may be a cause for
further investigation. In addition, organization security policies and

involving alteration of procedures, functions, packages or package bodies."
