  title "Ensure the 'GRANT' Action Audit Is Enabled"
  desc  "`GRANT` statements are used to grant privileges to Oracle database
users and roles, including the most powerful privileges and roles typically
available to the database administrators. Enabling this unified action audit
enables logging of all `GRANT` statements, whether successful or unsuccessful,
issued by the users regardless of the privileges held by the users to issue
such statements."
  desc  'rationale', "With unauthorized grants and permissions, a malicious
user may be able to change the security of the database, access/update
confidential data, or compromise the integrity of the database. Logging and
monitoring of all attempts to grant system privileges, object privileges or
roles, whether successful or unsuccessful, may provide forensic evidence about
potential suspicious/unauthorized activities as well as privilege escalation
activities. Any such activities may be a cause for further investigation. In
addition, organization security policies and industry/government regulations
may require logging of all user activities involving `GRANT`."
